# Host-Application
A University web application developement project, accompanied by Google Mentors (available on Google Store)

<h2>Hoster: Eat, Meet, Host, Repeat.</h2>
 
 <h4>The hoster application was made in order to incourage young people to know their neighbours by inviting them to shared meals.</h4>
 During this project, we experienced edge to edge product-life-cycle:
 1. Thinking of an idea.
 2. Market Research.
 3. Prototyping, Mockups, and designing.
 4. App Developement, Frontend and Server-Side (based on Cloud Firestore)
 5. User Testing, Micro-copy, creating app unique language and more.
 6. Arrange meals, and meet new people! 
 
 "With Hoster, you can attend joint dinners to meet new people from your surroundings! 
 All you need to do is create a meal (and choose which things you want guests to bring) 
 or join an existing meal to meet and get to know people in your area."

Hoster is also available on Google Play Store:
